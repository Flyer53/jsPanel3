### Version 1.11.0

Version 1.11 implements a number of changes and improvements. Most of them are just internal issues. But there are some other changes as well. See details below:

+ **option.size** has a changed functionality now: **option.size** now sets width and height of the content area of the jsPanel. Not width and height of the jsPanel as a whole!

+ **New property <code>content</code>** of the jsPanel representing all DOM within the content area of the jsPanel.
+ I removed **option.contentBG**.
+ For **childpanels** (meaning jsPanels that are appended to the content area of another jsPanel) dragging is limited to the containing element by default. This can be overruled using the draggable configuration object.
+ improved functionality of the events **onjspanelloaded** and **onjspanelclosed** including a bugfix: **onjspanelclosed** was fired twice in certain situations.
+ Some more code is now put in functions for better reusability and to avoid code repetitions.
+ internal improvements in the options: **autoclose, id, modal, rtl, size, theme, tooltip**
+ internal improvements in the methods: **addToolbar(), close(), closeChildpanels(), maximize(), storeData()**

+ **jsPanel.css** integrates some css rules that provide the possibility to generate text only tooltips using only css3

See the [API](http://jspanel.de/api.html) for more details

+ Added basic support for **themes** including various themes
+ Updated **maximize** function. jsPanels appended to the body element will maximize fullscreen within the window

---

### Version 1.3.0

**Bugfix** in option.size.width / option.size.height when using a function returning 0

**Changes:**

+ option.size.width < 150 will result in default width
+ option.size.height < 93 will result in default height

**Added functionality**

+ When using functions to calculate option.size.width/height or option.position.top/left/bottom/right the functions receive the jsPanel as argument
+ Start event of draggable feature has a function attached by default in order to make the draggable feature properly usable when using option.position.bottom/right in combination with option.size.width/height 'auto'

+ **position: { top: 'auto', left: 'auto' }** can now be abbreviated with **position: 'auto'**
+ **position: { top: 'center', left: 'center' }** can now be abbreviated with **position: 'center'**
+ **position** now additionally accepts values for bottom and right **{ bottom: 0, right: 0 }**
+ **automatic centering** now also works when width and/or height are set to 'auto', unless loading content is delayed because of using an asynchronous ajax request or the callback function to load the content
+ **additional shortcuts for option.position:**<br>
'top left' | 'top center' | 'top right' | 'center right' | 'bottom right' | 'bottom center' | 'bottom left' | 'center left'

+ **overflow** now alternatively accepts a string to set the css property overflow

---

### Version 1.1.0

The default settings are unnecessary and caused problems when the jsPanel was bigger in size than the containing parent element.

+ **Improvement:** Code for **_option.load_** improved. See the documentation for details.
+ **Improvement:** Correction in _jsPanel.css_
+ **Added functionality:** The settings object for **_option.ajax_** now optionally accepts functions that will be passed to _$.ajax().done()_, _$.ajax().fail()_, _$.ajax().always()_ and _$.ajax().then()_.

---

### Version 1.0.1
